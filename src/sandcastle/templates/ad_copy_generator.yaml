      Generate 5 Google Ads variants based on the product analysis. Each
      variant must include 3 headlines (max 30 characters each), 2
      descriptions (max 90 characters each), and display URL paths. Use
      different angles for each variant - feature-focused, benefit-focused,
      urgency, social proof, and competitive comparison.

      Generate 5 Meta/Facebook ad variants based on the product analysis.
      Each variant must include primary text (up to 125 characters for
      optimal display), a headline (max 40 characters), a link description,
      and a suggested CTA button type. Vary the creative approach across
      variants - storytelling, testimonial-style, direct response, question
      hook, and listicle format.
