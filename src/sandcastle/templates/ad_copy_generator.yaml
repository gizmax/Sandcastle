      Generate 5 Google Ads variants based on the product analysis. Each
      variant must include 3 headlines (max 30 characters each), 2

      different angles for each variant - feature-focused, benefit-focused,
      urgency, social proof, and competitive comparison.

      hook, and listicle format.
